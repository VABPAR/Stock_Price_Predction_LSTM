# Stock Price Prediction Using Long Short Term Memory Model

Utilizing cutting-edge machine learning methods, "Stock Price Prediction Using Long Short Term Memory Model" predicts stock market behavior. The study is focused on using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, a kind of recurrent neural network made to identify sequential patterns in data, particularly over long timescales. The LSTM model is trained to identify complex temporal correlations and underlying patterns within the market data by using previous stock price data as input. The goal of the projectÂ is to further knowledge of the effectiveness of LSTM-based techniques in forecasting stock price changes and their possible incorporation into investing decision-making processes. The project seeks to provide insights into the utility and constraints of using LSTM models for forecasting, as well as into the more general field of data-driven predictive modeling, through empirical assessment and validation.


This experiment's dataset is comprised of publicly available Tata Steel Limited information obtained from the Yahoo Finance website. This data was used to train the LSTM model and to make predictions using the historical stock prices. Close-of-day market stock prices were used to train and predict the model. Lastly, the model was used to predict, based on historical data, whether or not it can accurately forecast the trading of equities.
